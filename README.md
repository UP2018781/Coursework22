## End users

the end users will be people who are looking to buy lego bricks from many age ranges and also people who want to sell bricks. In this case the seller has been defined as one person: the store owner.

### what do they expect to see

end users need to be able to:

- easily navigate the website
  - after doing a basic outline of the navigation bar, I got feedback which said the basket and contact us would be better as icons (basket and phone respectively)

- see all the lego bricks available

- add bricks to a basket

- checkout & pay

### to do

- design a home page

- design a store page

![Store design](img/LegoStore.png)

Quick design in MSpaint, the idea is that when a brick is hovered over by the mouse, it gets larger and more information is displayed.

- design a basket page

- database
  - design a database system that is accessible for the server.
  - impliment the database system

### done
